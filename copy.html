      <p><img src="assets/images/copy_ssl.png" class="image-fluid rounded-lg" alt="Information Security SSL Certificate"></p>
      <p>As the world becomes increasingly digitalized, more and more organizations go online to give their customers and partners the freedom to work with their products and services anytime and anywhere. E-commerce stores and online marketplaces, internet banking, virtual schools, cloud applications, and many other online services make people's and businesses' lives more enjoyable, convenient, and efficient. However, with these benefits comes an increased risk of data breaches.</p>
		  <p>If your organization provides modern-day online services, you likely deal with your customers’ and partners’ sensitive information such as personal details and bank card numbers, or business transactions and commercial data. Keeping this data secure and private is one of the crucial tasks in building long-term trusting relationships with your counterparts and gaining a good reputation in the industry. Well, sometimes this task may be challenging. When traveling over public networks, information may be vulnerable to cyber attacks that grow more elaborate every day. So how can you protect sensitive data from a breach?</p>
      <p>The most reliable way to establish a secure information exchange is to encrypt it. This is where the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol comes in. Using sophisticated cryptographic algorithms, TLS protects data sent over the internet, ensuring that it remains secure and private. </p>
      <p class="alert alert-info">TLS is sometimes referred to as its older version, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), particularly when it comes to its indispensable component – the SSL certificate.</p>
      <p>To use the TLS protocol on your websites and web applications, you need to request and install SSL certificates on the servers where they reside. The rest of the work is done by smart devices and applications that know how to follow the protocol. Have you ever seen a warning message in your browser indicating that a website is not secure and should not be accessed? This occurs because most modern browsers are designed to protect users from cyber attacks by checking whether the website has an SSL certificate before opening it. However, there is much more to SSL certificates than just avoiding warning messages.</p>
      <p>Let’s clear up some questions that may arise when you get ready to secure your websites or applications with SSL certificates.</p>
      
      <h5>What is an SSL certificate?</h5>
      <p>It is a digital document provided by certificate authorities like AcmeSign that authenticates the identity of your website or web application. It ties your domain name to the server where it is installed, and sometimes includes the details of your organization. It works like a web passport that is presented to browsers and application clients when they connect to your organization’s server.</p>
      <p>Besides working as an ID, it also includes cryptographic components that take part in generating the keys that will encrypt the exchanged information.</p>
      
      <h5>Does my organization need an SSL certificate?</h5>
      <p>Even if your organization only collects your customers’ email addresses and names, these details still qualify as sensitive data and need protection. When entrusting their information to your website, your counterparts must be sure that it is legitimate. If no SSL certificate is installed on a website, there is no way to verify who operates it. As a result of a cyber attack like domain spoofing, a fraudulent server can impersonate an unprotected website, however, intruders cannot get a valid SSL certificate for the domain name controlled by someone else. Installing an SSL certificate is the best way to protect your business from such attacks.</p>
      <p>In addition to the security aspect, TLS-protected websites have better ranking in search engines, so an SSL certificate can make your services more discoverable.</p>

      <h5>How does an SSL certificate protect data?</h5>
      <p>Installing an SSL certificate enables the TLS protocol that is essential for data exchange security. It provides the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authentication: TLS enables your customers to verify that the server they are connected to is authentic and belongs to you, so they can trust it with their information.</li>
        <li>Confidentiality: all information sent and received is encrypted, meaning that even if it falls into the wrong hands, no one can read it.</li>
        <li>Integrity: the use of complex cryptography algorithms makes it possible to verify that no one altered the information while it was in transfer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>How do I get an SSL certificate?</h5>
      <p>Getting an SSL certifcate from AcmeSign is pretty easy:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>You use the functionality embedded in your server operating system to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). You can refer to your device operating system for the detailed steps and you are always welcome to contact your AcmeSign consultant if you need assistance.</p>
          <p>Then you send your CSR to <a href="mailto:request@acmesign.com">request@acmesign.com</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>First, AcmeSign confirms your request. Then, we verify the information provided in your CSR and verify that you control the domain name specified in your CSR.</p>
          <p>If everything’s in place, we issue your SSL certificate and sign it with our digital signature to prove its validity. Depending on the type of certificate you requested, the process may take up to one business day after you confirm your ownership of the domain.</p>
          <p>Then we send the certificate back to you together with our own certificates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>You import the provided certificates onto your server and you are good to go conquer the world of online services.</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>What type of SSL certificate do I need?</h5>
      <p>AcmeSign offers the following three types of SSL certificates: </p>
      <ul>
      <li>A Domain Validated (DV) certificate is the quickest and easiest to obtain. It only verifies that the person requesting the certificate owns the domain. DV certificates are suitable for websites like personal blogs or online stores with external payment processing.</li>
      <li>An Organization Validated (OV) certificate provides a higher level of security than DV. It verifies not only the domain ownership but also the organization's identity and physical address. You should choose OV certificates if your organization requires a higher level of security. For example, if you accept online payments and work with commercial data.</li>
      <li>An Extended Validation (EV) certificate provides the highest level of security and trust. It involves extensive verification of your organization's identity and other details. Use an EV certificate if you need the highest level of data security. For example, if you provide banking services or work with personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When deciding which type of certificate to choose, consider your business security needs, budget, and the level of trust you want to provide to your users. If you have a low-security website or personal blog, a DV certificate may be enough. But if you're running an e-commerce or financial website, an OV or EV certificate would be more appropriate.</p>
